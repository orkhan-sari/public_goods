# Free online resources for learning
Here I keep adding free online learning resources realted to different themes but mostly R and ML. 

* [This bookdown](https://bookdown.org/stanfordgsbsilab/ml-ci-tutorial/policy-learning-i---binary-treatment.html#non-parametric-policies) is good for ML based causal inference. I was mainly interested in the HTE -application of causal forest by Susan Athey.
    * Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing (Chap.4.1)
* Building a website with `distil` -  Check [Lisa Lendway's](https://lisalendway.netlify.app/) website which by the way she built with `distil`; and there is also a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=186&v=Fm3bsYCilEU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Flisalendway.netlify.app%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title).
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) book can be studied together with [lectures on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@datascienceanalytics1826/playlists) by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani.
